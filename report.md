## Introduction

I demonstrate malicious JavaScript code that targets Node.js developers using the npm package manager. The code modifies the package manager and takes over its `publish` command. It then silently attaches itself to unrelated packages that get published on that computer.

Hiding malware in package managers is nothing new.



  **hiding malware isn't new give example and typosquatting but show that Node.js is especially vulnerable, sometimes people try to steal token, this attack aims to automate the progress and cross the package-package barrier**

**say something about binary planting, and how it is kinda related but not really (people made such a big deal out of that lol) like, you could still do it if you edit the PATH...**
